## 🌟 What is ImpulsAr?

ImpulsAr is B2G blockchain infrastructure that modernizes how governments distribute social transfers. Built on Stellar, we deliver instant settlement, 99.97% cost reduction, and automatic inflation protection for beneficiaries—eliminating the inefficiencies of traditional banking systems.

### 💡 "Digital infrastructure for efficient social protection."

---

## 💔 The Problem We Solve

### $25 Billion Lost in Inefficiency

Every year, the Argentine government distributes ~$25 billion ARS in social transfers to 4.2 million families:

**Current System:**
```
ANSES → Bank Intermediary (3-5 days) → Beneficiary
  └─ $185M/year in banking fees
  └─ Inflation erodes value during delay
  └─ Zero public transparency
  └─ 30% population unbanked
```

### The "Invisible Cost"

**María receives $100,000 AUH today.**

**30 days later with 5% inflation:**
- Her $100,000 can now only buy 95 packages of noodles (down from 100)
- She lost $5,000 in purchasing power
- The bank intermediary captured the float returns
- **María, the most vulnerable, bears 100% of the inflation risk**

**This is not a bug. It's the design of the current system.**

---

## ✨ Our Solution: ImpulsAr + ARU Token

### Not a New Program. Better Infrastructure.

ImpulsAr modernizes **how** government transfers reach citizens, protecting their purchasing power automatically.

```
Government deposits funds
       ↓
Social Liquidity Fund
(Invests in CER-adjusted instruments: LECAPs, Money Market)
       ↓
ARU tokens issued on Stellar
(1 ARU = $1 ARS purchasing power, auto-adjusts for inflation)
       ↓
Instant blockchain distribution (~5 seconds)
       ↓
Citizen's balance grows with inflation automatically
```

### 🏛️ Business Model: B2G (Business to Government)

**How it's financed:**
The State pays a minimal monthly fee per active beneficiary, making the service **100% free for citizens**.

**Smart investment:**
- Government pays: $5.4M USD/year (SaaS licensing)
- Government saves: $185M USD/year (banking fees eliminated)
- **ROI: 34:1** - For every $1 invested, $34 saved

**The system pays for itself. It's not spending—it's budgetary efficiency.**


### 🛡️ Inflation Protection, Not Speculation

**ARU is NOT cryptocurrency speculation.**
**ARU is NOT investment.**
**ARU IS inflation-protected digital pesos.**

**María with ImpulsAr:**

**Day 1:**
- Receives: 100,000 ARU tokens
- Equivalent to: $100,000 ARS
- Can buy: 100 packages of noodles

**Day 30 (5% inflation):**
- Her balance shows: 105,000 ARU (auto-adjusted)
- Equivalent to: $105,000 ARS
- Can buy: **100 packages of noodles** (same purchasing power!)

**The $5,000 difference comes from the Social Liquidity Fund's CER-adjusted instruments.**

María didn't need to understand economics, open a savings account, or make any decisions. The system protected her automatically.

---

## 🎯 Three Simultaneous Innovations

### 1. 🛡️ Automatic Inflation Protection

**The Problem:**
Traditional cash or bank accounts lose purchasing power daily in Argentina (~31% annual inflation, INDEC 2024).

**Our Solution:**
ARU tokens are backed by CER-adjusted State instruments (LECAPs, BONCAP) that automatically grow with inflation. The National Asset Value (NAV) updates daily based on official BCRA inflation data.

**Real Impact:**
- María's $100,000 maintains buying power over 30 days
- Saves ~$5,000/month vs traditional system (5% inflation)
- Annualized: $60,000 protection for typical beneficiary

### 2. 🔍 Verifiable Transparency

**The Problem:**
Current system has zero public traceability. Citizens must "trust" the money reaches them.

**Our Solution:**
Every peso distributed has **immutable public evidence**:
- Multi-signature attestations (CNV-authorized Custodian + Independent Auditor)
- Monthly NAV published on-chain (Soroban smart contracts)
- Public transparency portal (anyone can verify reserves)

**Not "trust us." It's "verify yourself."**

### 3. ⚡ Radical Efficiency

**The Problem:**
Banking intermediaries charge $185M/year for distribution, with 3-5 day delays.

**Our Solution:**
- **Cost:** ~$50/year total (Stellar fees)
- **Speed:** ~5 seconds settlement
- **Scale:** 4.2M transactions in ~70 minutes

**Government Savings:**
- Direct cost reduction: 99.97% ($185M → $50K)
- Faster distribution: Weeks → Hours
- Better transparency: Zero → Total

**Business Impact:**
- Government invests: $5.4M USD/year (licensing)
- Government saves: $185M USD/year (banking elimination)
- Citizens pay: $0 (100% free service)

### ARU Token Mechanics

**What is CER?**
CER (Coeficiente de Estabilización de Referencia) is an official daily index published by Argentina's Central Bank (BCRA) that tracks inflation measured by INDEC.

**How ARU protects purchasing power:**

1. **María receives payment:** 100,000 ARU on Day 1
   - System records internally: 100,000 units at CER 1,000
   
2. **Inflation happens:** 30 days pass, CER rises to 1,050 (5-14% inflation)

3. **María's balance auto-adjusts:**
   - Internal units: Still 100,000 (unchanged)
   - Display value: 100,000 × 1.050 = **105,000 ARS** (adjusted)
   
4. **María buys groceries:** System calculates real-time
   - Spending $52,500 converts to: 52,500 ÷ 1.050 = 50,000 units
   - Remaining: 50,000 units = $52,500 ARS at current CER

**María never sees "units" or "CER." She only sees pesos that maintain buying power.**

## 🌟 Why Stellar? (Critical for Ideathon)

ImpulsAr chose Stellar blockchain for **5 technical reasons** that make it the ONLY viable option for government-scale social transfers:

### 1. 🏛️ Proven Government Precedent
- **Republic of Marshall Islands** uses Stellar for social transfers (USDM/ENRA) since November 2023
- **40,000 beneficiaries**, 0 security incidents, 89% adoption in first year
- Same economic pattern: *value appreciation → citizen (not intermediary)*
- **If it works for a sovereign nation, it can scale 100x for Argentina**

### 2. 💰 Economics That Make Sense
```
Monthly distribution to 4.2M beneficiaries:

Traditional Banking:  $185,000,000 USD/year
Stellar:             $50 USD/year
                     ─────────────────────
Savings:             99.97% cost reduction
```

**One distribution batch:**
- Stellar: 4.2M transactions × 100 stroops = 420M stroops = 42 XLM = **$4.20 USD**
- Banking: 4.2M × $5 average fee = **$21 million USD**

This isn't optimization. It's **disruption**.

### 3. ⚡ Native Assets = Simplicity
- **No complex smart contracts needed** (vs ERC-20 on Ethereum)
- ARU is a **first-class Stellar asset**, not a token on top of a token
- Built-in compliance features:
  - `AUTH_REQUIRED`: KYC integrated at protocol level
  - `CLAWBACK`: Fraud recovery (only with judicial order)
  - `TRUSTLINE`: Beneficiaries must opt-in (consent)
- Future: Multi-asset wallets (ARU + USDC + other stablecoins)

### 4. 🚀 Speed + Finality = Real-Time Protection
| Metric | Stellar | Ethereum | Solana | Traditional Bank |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|------------------|
| **Finality** | 5 seconds | 13 minutes (probabilistic) | 400ms | 3-5 days |
| **Reversible?** | No (immutable) | No (after ~12 confirmations) | Rare but possible (outages) | Yes (chargebacks) |
| **Uptime** | 99.99% (10 years) | 99.98% | 99.7% (outages 2022-2023) | 99.5% (business hours only) |

**Why this matters for María:**
- Emergency withdrawal: 5 seconds to blockchain → T+0 cash-out
- No "pending" limbo where inflation erodes value
- Irreversible = no bureaucratic reversals months later

### 5. 🛠️ Developer Experience We Needed
- **Stellar SDK**: Mature libraries (JS, Python, Go, Rust, Java)
- **Horizon API**: RESTful with excellent docs
- **Stellar Expert**: Public explorer for transparency
- **Soroban**: Rust/WASM smart contracts for attestation registry
- **No gas price wars** (fixed fees), no MEV, no front-running

### ❌ Why NOT Other Blockchains?

| Blockchain | Deal-Breaker |
|------------|--------------|
| **Ethereum** | $2-50 per transaction = $8.4M-$210M for single monthly distribution (inviable) |
| **Solana** | No government precedent, historical outages, weaker compliance primitives |
| **Algorand** | No proven social transfer use case, smaller ecosystem |
| **Bitcoin** | No multi-asset support, $2-5 fees, 60-min finality |
| **Polygon/L2s** | Complexity of bridging, still requires ETH for gas, weaker finality |

**Stellar is the ONLY blockchain with:**
✅ Government precedent (Marshall Islands)  
✅ Sub-cent fees  
✅ 5-second finality  
✅ Native multi-asset  
✅ Built-in compliance

## 🌍 International Precedent

### Marshall Islands: ENRA/USDM (November 2025)

The Republic of Marshall Islands launched ENRA (Ecological & National Reparation Asset), a digital currency that distributes sovereign bond yields directly to citizens.

**Key Learnings Applied to ImpulsAr:**

| Aspect | Marshall Islands | ImpulsAr Argentina |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Scale** | 40,000 people | 4.2M (100x larger) |
| **Launch** | Nov 2025 | Proposed 2026 |
| **Asset Base** | USD sovereign bonds | ARS CER-adjusted fund |
| **Inflation Context** | ~2% annually | ~31% annually (INDEC) |
| **Mechanism** | Direct distribution | NAV-based auto-adjustment |
| **Programs** | Single UBI | Multi-program (AUH, Alimentar, Progresar) |
| **Wallet** | Lomalo (custom) | Crossmint (universal) |

**Core Similarity:** 
Both systems transfer value appreciation to citizens instead of intermediaries. ImpulsAr scales this proven model 100x with local Argentine instruments.

**Why It Works:**
- Stellar blockchain: 99.9% uptime, government-tested
- Instant settlement: ~5 seconds
- Minimal fees: ~$0.00001 per transaction
